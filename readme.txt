Next things to do: generate html5 version, establish according browser fork for non flash browsers like


if (swfobject.hasFlashPlayerVersion("7.0.0")) {
// User has flash
} else {
// User does not have flash
window.location="noFlash.php";
}

according to http://rossholdway.com. Furthermore to add a live stream option to the FLV player.
